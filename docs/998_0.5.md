- [core] Socket source now uses non-blocking IO. [[#554]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/554)
- [core] Add preferred local parallelism to all the sources and sinks. [[#552]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/552)
- [core] `InsertWatermarksProcessor` will now log late events. [[#551]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/551)
- [core] Add projection and predicate capability to map reader. [[#490]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/490)
- [core] Hazelcast version is updated to 3.9. [[#474]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/474)

#### Code Samples Improvements

- Overall module reorganization roughly divided to code samples using Pipeline API and Core API.
- Several examples migrated to use the new Pipeline API.
- New examples using hash join enrichment and co group. 
- New code samples illustrating the new event journal and fault tolerance features.
- New code samples showing how to use HDFS with `java.util.stream`.


## Fixes

- [core] The method `Job.getJobStatus()` does not reflect actual status during cancellation. [[#580]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/580)
- [core] Add missing serializer for `Session` type. [[#562]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/562)
- [core] The method `Traversers.traverseStream()` should close the stream when exhausted. [[#560]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/560)
- [core] Kafka source should throw when partition count is less than global parallelism. [[#559]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/559)
- [core] Suppress exception for flow control packet when the member has already left the cluster. [[#556]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/556)
- [core] Fix the ignored charset in `StreamSocketP`. [[#553]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/556)
- [core] `JetClassLoader` should not throw an exception on the method `findResource()`. [[#549]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/549)
- [core] Add cache manager in order not to require a dependency on `javax.cache`. [[#485]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/485)
- [core] Fix NPE when releasing uninitialized `ResourceStore`. [[#478]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/478)
- [core] Replace `ReadFileStreamP` with batch file processor. [[#373]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/373)
- [core] `ReadFileStreamP` should respect Outbox limit. [[#337]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/337)
- [kafka] When init phase for the job fails, `StreamKafkaP` throws NPE. There should be a null check. [[#568]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/568)
- [hdfs] Making sure a proper global cleanup is performed on job cancellation. [[#572]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/572)
