https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1435[#1435]
* [core] Configured classloader in the Hazelcast configuration is now set
as the parent of job classloader.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1395[#1395]
* [core] Job classloader now prints a warning if it's used after a job is completed.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1315[#1315],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1446[#1446]
* [core] Snapshot creation is now handled gracefully even if the execution
is already completed on a member.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1397[#1397]
* [core] Added check to ensure that any explicit Hazelcast IMDG
dependency has the same version as the shaded one.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1412[#1412]
* [core] Fixed a `StackOverFlowError` when a very long path in DAG is used.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1430[#1430]

=== Breaking Changes

* [pipeline-api] Previously it was possible to close the buffer in
`SourceBuilder` when building a streaming source. However, a streaming
source by definition should never close. The `buffer.close()` method now throws
an exception when called inside a streaming source.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1394[#1394]
* [core] Signatures of `SourceProcessors.convenientSourceP` and `convenientTimestampedSourceP` have been updated to support fault tolerance.
