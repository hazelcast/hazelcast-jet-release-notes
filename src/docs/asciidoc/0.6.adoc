[[fixes-06]]
=== Fixes

* [core] Avoid race between job cancellation and completion. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/604[#604]
* [core] Do not send a join request for a job unless Job.join() is explicitly called. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/628[#628]
* [core] When master node leaves cluster, job would restart even if auto-restart was disabled. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/683[#683]
* [core] When using map source, returning null in a projection would cause rest of the items to be dropped. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/669[#669]
* [core] When DAG fails to deserialize on job submission from client, the exception was not returned to user. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/794[#794]
* [core] Fix for `ClassNotFoundException` when restoring from snapshot when the key class is not on Jet classpath. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/778[#778]
* [core] Assert that always same item offered to Outbox after a rejection. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/808[#808]
* [kafka] Kafka sink should ensure that all records are sent before snapshot. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/611[#611]
* [kafka/hadoop] Package names reorganized to have better support for module systems.

[[tc-06]]
=== Technical Changes

* [pipeline-api] Grouping and aggregation in Pipeline API now are done through the methods `.groupingKey()` and `.aggregate()`.
* [pipeline-api] Package names for Pipeline API have been reorganized.
* [core] Job cancellation can now only be done through `Job.cancel()` rather than `Job.getFuture().cancel()`.
* [core] IStreamMap, IStreamList and IStreamCache have been renamed to IMapJet, IListJet and ICacheJet, respectively.
* [core] Dedicated `tryProcessWatermark()` method is now responsible for processing Watermarks in a processor and watermarks will be forwarded automatically once it returns true.
* [core] `start-jet.sh`, `submit-jet.sh` and other scripts have been renamed to have prefix "jet" instead.
* [core] `CloseableProcessorSupplier` has been replaced with a `close()` method on the Processor instead.
* [core] `complete` methods on `ProcessorMetaSupplier` and `ProcessorSupplier` have been renamed to `close()`.
* [java.util.stream] `DistributedStream` creation have been moved to `DistributedStream` class from Map and List instances. We strongly
suggest to switch to Pipeline API instead of `java.util.stream` API.
