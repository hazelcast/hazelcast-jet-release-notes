==== Code Samples Improvements

- Overall module reorganization roughly divided to code samples using Pipeline API and Core API.
- Several examples migrated to use the new Pipeline API.
- New examples using hash join enrichment and co group. 
- New code samples illustrating the new event journal and fault tolerance features.
- New code samples showing how to use HDFS with `java.util.stream`.


=== Fixes

- [core] The method `Job.getJobStatus()` does not reflect actual status during cancellation. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/580[[#580]]
- [core] Add missing serializer for `Session` type. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/562[[#562]]
- [core] The method `Traversers.traverseStream()` should close the stream when exhausted. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/560[[#560]]
- [core] Kafka source should throw when partition count is less than global parallelism. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/559[[#559]]
- [core] Suppress exception for flow control packet when the member has already left the cluster. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/556[[#556]]
- [core] Fix the ignored charset in `StreamSocketP`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/556[[#553]]
- [core] `JetClassLoader` should not throw an exception on the method `findResource()`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/549[[#549]]
- [core] Add cache manager in order not to require a dependency on `javax.cache`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/485[[#485]]
- [core] Fix NPE when releasing uninitialized `ResourceStore`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/478[[#478]]
- [core] Replace `ReadFileStreamP` with batch file processor. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/373[[#373]]
- [core] `ReadFileStreamP` should respect Outbox limit. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/337[[#337]]
- [kafka] When init phase for the job fails, `StreamKafkaP` throws NPE. There should be a null check. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/568[[#568]]
- [hdfs] Making sure a proper global cleanup is performed on job cancellation. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/572[[#572]]
