- [core] Socket source now uses non-blocking IO. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/554[#554]
- [core] Add preferred local parallelism to all the sources and sinks. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/552[#552]
- [core] `InsertWatermarksProcessor` will now log late events. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/551[#551]
- [core] Add projection and predicate capability to map reader. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/490[#490]
- [core] Hazelcast version is updated to 3.9. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/474[#474]

- [kafka] When a job, which includes Kafka source, is cancelled, `StreamKafkaP` throws `InterruptedException`. This exception should be prevented or it should give a descriptive log. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/570[#570]
- [kafka] Add optional projection function to Kafka reader. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/534[#534]
- [kafka] Add snapshotting support for Kafka reader. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/500[#500]

==== Code Samples Improvements

- Overall module reorganization roughly divided to code samples using Pipeline API and Core API.
- Several examples migrated to use the new Pipeline API.
- New examples using hash join enrichment and co group. 
- New code samples illustrating the new event journal and fault tolerance features.
- New code samples showing how to use HDFS with `java.util.stream`.


=== Fixes

- [core] The method `Job.getJobStatus()` does not reflect actual status during cancellation. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/580[#580]
- [core] Add missing serializer for `Session` type. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/562[#562]
- [core] The method `Traversers.traverseStream()` should close the stream when exhausted. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/560[#560]
- [core] Kafka source should throw when partition count is less than global parallelism. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/559[#559]
- [core] Suppress exception for flow control packet when the member has already left the cluster. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/556[#556]
- [core] Fix the ignored charset in `StreamSocketP`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/556[#553]
- [core] `JetClassLoader` should not throw an exception on the method `findResource()`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/549[#549]
- [core] Add cache manager in order not to require a dependency on `javax.cache`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/485[#485]
- [core] Fix NPE when releasing uninitialized `ResourceStore`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/478[#478]
- [core] Replace `ReadFileStreamP` with batch file processor. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/373[#373]
- [core] `ReadFileStreamP` should respect Outbox limit. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/337[#337]
- [kafka] When init phase for the job fails, `StreamKafkaP` throws NPE. There should be a null check. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/568[#568]
- [hdfs] Making sure a proper global cleanup is performed on job cancellation. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/572[#572]
